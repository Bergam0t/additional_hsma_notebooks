You should give them mean results as a minimum, but you may consider providing additional results too if you have time.\n",

    "You also need to calculate and provide them with the mean queuing times across the trial (eg mean queue for registration across all runs, for GP etc - so four numbers that you would report).  You’ll need a new method in your Trial class to calculate this.  You should find this a helpful output, as it’ll help you compare scenarios easily.  Report these means to 1 decimal place.\n",
