    "You are setting up a model for a local trust that runs a number of different clinics.  To begin with, they’d like you to develop a proof of concept that models some of the functionality of weight loss clinics and sexual health clinics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- All of the organisation’s clinics have a clinic name and a list of staff who work there.  \n",
    "- Any clinic can open or close (and the model will need to be able to record whether the clinic is open or closed)\n",
    "- There should be a means of displaying all the members of staff who work at the clinic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weight Loss Clinics** also have a lead nurse, which should be recorded, and sometimes this person isn’t already on the staff list.  There should be a way to check if they are, and if they’re not, to add them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sexual Health Clinics** have the facility to book tests in the clinic’s appointment book, which records a patient’s name against their appointment time.  You should also build in functionality to display the entries in the appointment book.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve built the proof of concept described above, create a couple of new weight loss clinics - one in Cornwall, and one in Devon, with lists of staff, and a lead nurse.  \n",

    "Test the functionality of checking whether a given lead nurse is in the list of staff or not.  \n",

    "Also, create a sexual health clinic in Cornwall, and book in an appointment for Jessica Fletcher at 1100.  \n",

    "You have 50 minutes, and you should work together as a group on this task.  There is no single correct approach for this - this will also develop your skills in designing code for a purpose.\n"
