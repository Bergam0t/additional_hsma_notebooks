    "In the code below you’ll find a Python program that has a lot of errors. Your challenge is to fix them and get the code working!\n",
    "\n",
    "Be warned, there are 53 errors (depending on how you count them)!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Try to work out how the code's supposed to work first (I’ve deliberately omitted comments just to be extra cruel).  That will help you a lot.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you may get it running, but it may not work as expected.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Test everything very carefully and thoroughly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You should also add comments to the code to explain what each bit is doing (this will help), and also add comments for things you’ve fixed.\n",

    "\n",
    "Can you fix it and get a working piece of code?  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end we’ll pick one group to talk us through the code, and how they fixed it.  Or didn’t, and we’ll get the cohort to chip in with how to fix it!\n"
